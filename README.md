# k8s-cluster

My home K8S cluster running on [k3s](https://k3s.io/), powered by
[Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) with
[SOPS](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/) for encrypting secrets.

Loosely based on the amazing work in
[k8s-at-home/template-cluster-k3s](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/template-cluster-k3s)
